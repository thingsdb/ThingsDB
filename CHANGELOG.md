# v1.5.0

* Comments can be placed anywhere that whitespace is allowed.
* Comments are no longer stored within closures. This behavior was previously
  partially enforced, and now it is strictly followed.
* Statements must be separated with semicolons. Syntax checking is now more strict.
* Removed syntax option for selecting a collection scope by Id.
* The collection Id and collection root Id no longer need to be equal.

  _(The response for `node_info()` still contains the `next_free_id` for the global free Id)_
* Added `dump` option to the `export(..)` function for a full collection export.
* Added function `import()` which can import a collection export dump.
* Added function `root()` for getting the collection root as thing.
* Function `export(..)` can no longer be used in queries with changes.
* A bug with adding enumerators to restricted lists has been fixed.

* The `change._tasks` structure in C code has been renamed.
  This has no impact on user-facing functionality.
* Replaced Docker images _(both tests and builds)_ with newer versions.
* Removed `ti_pkg_check` hack for old compilers. _(this is no longer required with recent compilers)_
* Added integer minimun `INT_MIN` and maximum `INT_MAX` constants with corresponding values.
* The primary domain for the ThingsDB website has been changed from `.net` to `.io`.
* Several new mathematical functions have been added: `abs(..)`, `ceil(..)`,
  `cos(..)`, `exp()..`, `floor(..)`, `log10(..)`, `log2(..)`, `loge(..)`,
  `pow(..)`, `sin(..)`, `sqrt(..)` and `tan(..)`.
* Added mathematical constants `MATH_E` and `MATH_PI` with corresponding values.
* libcleri is now integrated into the core ThingsDB codebase, eliminating the need for separate installation.

## Breaking changes from v0.10.x -> v1.0.0

* Removed `.watch()`, `.unwatch()` and `.emit()` functions on type `thing`.
* Removed the following protocol types *(replaced with room protocol)*:
  - `TI_PROTO_CLIENT_WATCH_INI` (1)
  - `TI_PROTO_CLIENT_WATCH_UPD` (2)
  - `TI_PROTO_CLIENT_WATCH_DEL` (3)
  - `TI_PROTO_CLIENT_WATCH_STOP` (4)
  - `TI_PROTO_CLIENT_REQ_WATCH` (35)
  - `TI_PROTO_CLIENT_REQ_UNWATCH` (36)
* Insert data using syntax like `{"X": ...}` *(where X is a reserved keyword)*
  is no longer possible.
* Function `.def()` on a closure is removed. Use `str(closure)` instead.
* Changed the return values of the following types:
  - `regex`: From object to string (e.g. `{"*": "/.*/"}` -> `"/.*/"`).
  - `closure`: From object to string (e.g. `{"/": "||nil"}` -> `"||nil"`).
                Note that `str(closure)` returns formatted closure code and
                just the type `closure` returns the closure as-is.
  - `error`: From object to string (e.g. `{"!": ...}` -> `"some error msg"`).
* Backup template no longer supports `{EVENT}` as template variable. This variable
  is replaced with `{CHANGE_ID}`.
* All the counter properties with `*event*` are replaced with `*change*`.
  Counter property `changes_quorum_lost` is renamed to simply `quorum_lost`.
* All the node(s) info properties with `*event*` are replaced with `*change*`.
  Property `next_thing_id` is changed to `next_free_id` as Ids are used
  for more than just things.
* Previous `EVENT` (or `MODIFY`) access to a scope is renamed to `CHANGE`.
  (Note: this is not truly breaking since both `EVENT` and `MODIFY` are marked
  as deprecated)
* Previous `WATCH` access is renamed to `JOIN`. `WATCH` is marked as deprecated.
  (Note: this is not truly breaking since `WATCH` is marked as deprecated)
* It is no longer possible to watch the `@node` scope. All socket connections
  will receive `NODE_STATUS` changes as soon as the client is authenticated.
  Watch (JOIN) privileges are no longer required on the `@node` scope for this
  feature.
* Protocol `TI_PROTO_CLIENT_NODE_STATUS (0)` no longer returns a plain string
  with the status but instead a `map` with `id` containing the node Id
  and `status` with the new node status.
* Function `remove(..)` on a `list` type will remove *all* values where a
  given closure evaluates to `true`. The return value will be a new `list` with
  the values which are removed. An alternative value is no longer possible.
